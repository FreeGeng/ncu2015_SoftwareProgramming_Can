Software Programming final project - Tower

There is totally two packages implemented with java.
ClashOfTower_Server_v1.8 is the server.
ClashOfTower_v2.1 is the client.

Each server needs 4 clients to establish the game.
You need to change the server IP address in TCPSM of every client to connect the correct server IP address.
The game will establish after four clients connect to the server.
